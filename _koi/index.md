## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* In general, words are delimited by whitespace characters. Compounds in Komi-Permyak are usually written separated, and in these cases the relation ([compound]()) is used to connect the tokens.
* According to typographical rules, many punctuation marks are attached to a neighboring word. At the moment hyphenated compounds such as командно-политическӧй “command political” or кыдз-нибудь “somehow” are analysed as individual tokens.
* A whitespace separating digits in a large number is not treated as a word separator. For example, 1 000 000 (“1,000,000” by English rules) is one token.
